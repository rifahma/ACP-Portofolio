This is my personal project that I worked from DeepLearning.AI ACP course using OpenAI GPT-4 model as an agent. 

Steps that I follow to make the ACP server works as a senior insurance agent (ACP Client) that connect and communicate with a hospital (ACP server):
1. Building the Senior Insurance Agent with CrewAI; the process includes identify the description, role, and expected output
2. Wrapping the RAG Agent Into an ACP Server; export the codes for agent making inside of the directory called 'my_acp_project' and named it as 'crew_agent_server.py' (it will be used for defining our agent and run the ACP server)
3. (Will update soon)
